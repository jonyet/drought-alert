# drought-alert
utilize wunderground API to gather data for a given area to alert the user that they should water their young trees

**Prerequisites**
you'll need to sign up on weather underground [https://www.wunderground.com/weather/API/] to get an API key for your requests.

**Getting Started**
once you have your API key, clone this project and create a copy of `.envschema`. rename it `.env` and input your API key within. the `.gitignore` will already omit your private key from exposure. it's free, so big deal, but good for practice, right? after doing this you should be able to just install your dependencies and run the script.

```npm install```

```npm start```
